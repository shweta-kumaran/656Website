            <!-- <p>I am a second-year junior Computer Science major and Statistics minor at Texas A&M University. My interest in programming, software development, and data analytics started in middle school where I was fascinated by Scratch. As I went to highschool, I noticed myself enjoying the mathematics and programming courses. From there, I applied to the <a href="https://tams.unt.edu/">Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science (TAMS) at the University of North Texas</a>, where I went for my junior and senior years of high school. Here, I took undergraduate courses in the computer science pathway. The rigor and concepts of the courses I took left me more interested in the field of technology and programming. While at TAMS, I participated in undergraduate research in the fields of Physics and Marketing. Within these research opportunities, I got to utilize my technological skills in a different discipline. This experience left me with a greater interest in finding ways to utiliize technology to solve problems. As I came into Texas A&M, I took part in the AggiE Challenge where I participated undergraduate research in the field of Civil Engineering. Here, I created intelligence systems to scale big data to help better respond to natural disasters. Beyond coursework, I got to experience the field in terms of the workforce. This past summer, I was a Software Engineering Intern at Thomson Reuters where I worked on a backend tool that provides dependency information to help aid developers in triaging issues. Currently, I am a Undergraduate Teaching Assistant where I assist students in understanding C++ concepts and assist faculty in the course functionality. Through these experiences, in conjunction with coursework and personal projects, I had the opportunity to better fine tune my skills and put them to practice. Beyond the classroom and experiences, I have also been apart of various organizations and activities. At Texas A&M, I currently serve as the External Socials Officer for Aggie Women in Computer Science. I organize and plan events to help foster a community of technology enthusiasts. I am also a project manager within Aggie Coding Club where I manage a team of developers for our bus application, Reveille Rides. Outside of coding, I enjoy listening to music, journaling, and spending time with family and friends. I am avid pen enthusiast and have a running collection. Thanks for getting to learn more about me and feel free to contact me! </p> -->
            <p>I am taking CSCE656 to learn and understand the influence of media design alongside computers and technology to be a better developer and media producer.</p>

            <p>A challenge with Spotify is identifying new music reccomendations that are not advertised or in the top charts. Although Spotify reccommends music, they do not showcase many small artists. They use general public preferences with my listening history to tailor my personalized preferences. Thus, sometimes leaving out smaller or newer artists.</p>
